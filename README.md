# Patients’ Experience in Public Healthcare

## Overview
This project analyzes patient satisfaction data as part of the broader "Patients’ Experience in Public Healthcare" study. The specific focus of this repository is the Hospital Consumer Assessment Analysis, which examines patient satisfaction. This work was completed as part of the Data Analytics and Visualization class for the MS in Computer Science program at Purdue University. The project was a collaborative effort, but this repository contains only the code for the Patient Satisfaction part.
